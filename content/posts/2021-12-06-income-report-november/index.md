Previous month I decided to share publicly my monthly income report, and a lot of people showed interest in this.

These reports are not meant to be seen as bragging, but more as motivation that it is possible to make a living from the things you love doing.

I will also take advantage of this opportunity and will update you on our progress and our plans for the next month.

## TL;DR

Revenue: **$10,603.17**

Expenses: **$8,338.02**

Profit: **$2,265.15**

_Apparently, more revenue does not mean more profit 🤔_

### Income sources

AdSense: **$1,127.26**

Sponsorships: **$9475.92**

November has been a crazy month when it comes to sponsorships. One of the best so far.

I am quite picky when it comes to choosing with what companies to partner with. All the brand deals start with my content plan (that I build based on the community requests). When a company approaches me, I send them some of the project ideas that match their technology.

That's how we ended up partnering with [Voximplant](https://voximplant.com/) to build the highly requested [video calling application in React Native](https://youtu.be/rb70_TXRQNE).

We also partnered with [Stream](https://getstream.io/) and [build a full-fledged messaging app](https://youtu.be/TKm4EHgSxUI) in under 3 hours 🤯

I am grateful for these opportunities because they give me the possibility to grow the notJust.dev team and community. As you can see, most of the revenue was reinvested back in the channel: equipment, team salaries, video production, the prize pool for the [Squid Game content](https://youtu.be/0mohD3VW6N4) and of course some cookies 🍪.

## Plans for December

In December, I decided to focus all my time and energy on finishing [The full-stack mobile developer course](https://academy.notjust.dev/). Creating a high-end and in-depth course, that will teach not only React Native but also AWS Amplify, is more complicated than I thought. That's because of my perfectionism as I want this course to be the best course out there that will take you by hand from beginning to building full-stack mobile apps and deploying them to market.

The weekly livestreams on Friday will not pause thanks to Lukas - the new tutor at notJust.dev. Lukas is my good friend and university colleague. We both worked as Teacher Assistants at our University, teaching Introduction to programming, OOP, Android Development. I am pretty sure you will love his teaching style. We already did an amazing stream together where Lukas built a [Crypto price Tracker](https://youtu.be/K6i02mJc8Zc).
