Hey notJust Developers, are you ready for a new **Challenge**?

Join the **notJust Hack** from 25th to 27th November, and build that App that you always wanted to.

## Why participate?

Use this opportunity to:

- Build the app that you always wanted to
- Learn a new technology, framework, tool
- Attend **daily workshops** and learn from the best
- Join the **group coaching** sessions and get help from our mentors

We promise a weekend full of fun activities, learnings and hard work.

As I always say, the best way to learn something new is to build a real project with it.

## Demo day

To participate at the demo day, you will have to submit a 3 minutes long video presentation of your project together with a link to the github repository. The submissions that follow the requirements will be played at the Demo Day, on 28th November, and our juries will vote for the best ones.

For the video presentation, we recommend following this structure:

- Introduce yourself and the project in one sentence
- Talk about the problem. Why is there a need for your application. It can also be for your personal need, that’s fine as long as there is a purpose behind.
- Talk about the solution.
  How are you planning to solve this problem. Here, you have the opportunity to show your vision for the project. You defiently won’t manage to build everything in just 3 days, but it’s important to visualise how the solution will look in the end.
- What technologies did you use?
- Demo. Show us the main functionalities of your application. Even if not everything is perfect.
- What are your next steps? Do you plan on continuing to work on the app?

❗ The video should be maximum 3 minutes. In order to give everyone the possibility to present, we will stop the video presentations at 3 minutes.

## Evaluation criteria

All projects will be judged by our juries.

The criteria will be:

- **The idea**
  The usefulness of the project in real-world
- **UI/UX**
  Keep it simple and consistent. There is not enough time to invest in sophisticated UIs and animations. The focus should be on simplicity, usability, and overall look of the application.
- **Realisation**
  The completeness and complexity of your project will be evaluated here. We recommend focusing on having the most critical features “workable” first.
- **Presentation**
  Your presentation skills

Requirements:

- The project should be a **Mobile Application** build with any tools/technologies/frameworks you know best
- **The project should be started during the Hackathon**
- You can work alone, or in teams

## Need help?

Join our discord channel and get help from our mentors.

Every day, we will host a workshop to help you on your journey of building an app in 3 days.

Also, we will host Group Coaching sessions daily where you can ask questions and get help from us.

## Feedback from our previous events

![Our team is very thankful to you for providing us with such opportunity and recognition. We would love to collaborate with you on our idea and take your inputs to improve our product.](./testimonial1.png)

![Thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in the competition. I saw very good startups there so I was surprised I won. Hoping to see more of these events in the future, in uncertain times like this you are truly helping out a lot of people and fostering talents. I truly believe that NotJustDev is going to be not just a youtube channel but a huge incubator that pushes the boundary of what's possible in the world of startups.](./testimonial3.png)

![Good news, the app was submitted to the App Store and Google Play Store and was approved for both! So we are now officially launched](./testimonial2.png)
