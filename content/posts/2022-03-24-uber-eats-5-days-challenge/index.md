Hey notJust Developers 👋

I am so excited to announce our first **Intensive 5 DAYS coding challenge!** 🚀🚀🚀

We have started preparing this challenge 6 months ago, and we made sure it's packed with value.

By the end of the 5 Days challenge, you will walk away more confident in your skills of building complex, full-stack, end-to-end projects with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/).

## What will we build?

We will build not 1, not 2, but 3 React Native applications and we will connect them together using one common backend.

### Day 4

During the fourth day, we will connect the **Driver app** to the backend. The focus will be on syncing data between the driver app and the user app, so that the user always knows where is the driver on the map.

### Day 5

The last day will be focused on creating and connecting the **Restaurant side app** to the whole system.

The dashboard will be created using ReactJS. This is a great way to see how multiple apps are connected together.
